## Challenge 2 : Use CNNs to Classify Handwritten Digits

This is the second challenge of AI2E. After 2 weeks and half of learning, you have now the skills to build a neural network, train it and test it. 

In the neural network workshop, you created a special fully-connected neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST Dataset. You considered back then that each pixel is a feature (Thus you had 28x28= 784 input nodes). 

In the next workshop(CNNs), you learnt a better way to extract features from images through a serie of convolution & pooling layers. We want you to apply this concept to the same task! 

Thus the challenge consists on :
* Define the different transformation to apply to the images
* Define your neural net architecture
* Test different hyper parameters 
* Visualize the results 
* Test your predictions

Please send your HTML version of the notebook to our email address schoolofai.algiers@esi.dz
You'll get a personalized review on your notebooks by email ;) 

Good Luck ! =) 
Note : This challenge is required for you to get the certificate of AI2E.
