This is the third challenge of AI2E. Let's play with some recurrent architectures! 
In this challenge, your goal is to generate a fake Avengers Scripts. 
The starter_notebook explains all the steps you need to do and display some already coded methods that will help you with your solution.
You'll be judged based on your model architecture. 


Thus the challenge consists on :
* Explore the texts 
* Create the lookup table 
* Preprocess and Load the data 
* Build your RNN architecture 
* Train your model 
* Test and show us your scripts ! 

Please send your HTML version of the notebook to our email address schoolofai.algiers@esi.dz
