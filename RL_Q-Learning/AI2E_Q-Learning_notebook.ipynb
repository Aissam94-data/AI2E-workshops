    "We will use the following functions:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>env.reset: resets the environment and returns a random initial state.</li>\n",
    "<li>env.step(action): advances the environment by one timestep.</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "<br/> Notice the current location state of our taxi is coordinate (3, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/> You'll also notice there are four (4) locations that we can pick up and drop off a passenger represented by **R**, **G**, **Y**, **B** or [(0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,3)] in (row, col) coordinates. Our illustrated passenger is in location Y and they wish to go to location R.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "Alright! We began with understanding Reinforcement Learning with the help of real-world analogies. We then dived into the basics of Reinforcement Learning and the different concepts ! After that we framed a Self-driving cab as a Reinforcement Learning problem. We then used OpenAI's Gym in python to provide us with a related environment, where we can develop our agent and evaluate it. So we went ahead to implement the Q-learning algorithm from scratch. The agent's performance improved significantly after Q-learning which means it can dropoff the passanger in the right destination with 0 penalities comparing with rhe training phase where it was taking random actions which doesn't lead necessarily to the wanted destination, but towards the end you could see that it's taking only the right one.\n",
